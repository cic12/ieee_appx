## Human Torque Prediction Datasets

### Test 1

	fig_hte_mmg_iso_dataset.pdf

Human torque prediction dataset for test 1, with processed MMG muscle activity, system states of knee joint angle, $\theta$, and angular velocity, $\dot{\theta}$, and reference human joint torque, $\tau_{\mathrm{ref}}$, recorded during exercise 1: isometric contraction.

### Test 2

Human torque prediction dataset for test 2 with processed EMG muscle activity, system states of knee joint angle, $\theta$, and angular velocity, $\dot{\theta}$, and reference human joint torque, $\tau_{\mathrm{ref}}$, recorded during exercise 1: isometric contraction.

### Test 3
